## Routing
    1. Show hidden sections (not real routing, only content management based on visibility)
    2. Hash router (older method of routing)
    3. History API (modern method of routing, but harder to implement)

* We will use history api for url change and visibility for content management
* In this case we won't need templating for content rendering (check lit-html)
